You can do this with multiple different vector DBs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vector stores as normal tools, or you can set `return_direct=True` to really just use the agent as a router."

            "Ruff is a code quality tool for Python that combines a linter and formatter into one tool. It is designed to be used alongside a formatter, such as Ruff's own formatter or Black, and can also replace popular Flake8 plugins. Ruff supports Python 3 and does not require the installation of Rust. It also has a preview feature that allows you to see how your code will be formatted before making any changes. Ruff is highly configurable and supports a variety of settings and integrations.\u001b[0m\n",
